This thesis explores the potential of using Generative AI (GenAI), specifically large language models, to enhance the field of public affairs through document classification. Public affairs professionals struggle with the volume of parliamentary documents, which can lead to missing information relevant to their interests. This study investigates a custom-designed AI tool that automates the classification of parliamentary documents, providing curated insights to public affairs organisations. This tool can become a resource in the pluralistic public affairs tradition in Denmark, which is defined by competition between public affairs organisations, potentially offering a competitive advantage.
The core of this research is a case study involving four organizations: Schultz Jørgensen & K, Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, Dansk Standard, and Danske Gymnasier. These organizations implemented the AI tool, and their experiences were evaluated through a process-based impact assessment framework supported by a program theory.
The findings suggest the specific AI tool does not enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public affairs operations, because the AI tool has a tendency to classify too many documents as relevant, resulting in too many false positives, which, in turn, makes the organisations not read the overview of the AI-classified relevant documents. However, Danske Gymnasier reads the overview of documents and finds the overview useful to a small extent. The findings in this thesis highlights areas for improvement in the AI-tool and offer insights into the broader implications of integrating GenAI in public affairs.
This thesis contributes to the academic literature by providing empirical data on the practical application of GenAI in public affairs and offering recommendations for future research and tool development in this evolving field.
