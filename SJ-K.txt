We offer comprehensive solutions spanning diverse areas, ensuring our clients not only enhance their communication strategies but also build formidable brands, shape public perception, and expertly navigate the ever-changing business landscape.

Strategy
We all need strategies to set a clear direction, to bring people together and to prioritize resources. The strategies fly under different names and can be cross-cutting – e.g., basic narratives, communication and brand strategies or they can be specialized strategies within Public Affairs, Sustainability, Corporate Communications or Sustainability.

Public Affairs
Political processes are changing both internationally, nationally, and locally. There are new demands and new opportunities for both companies and NGOs to create and shape future legislation. We contribute to new solutions through innovation and partnerships.

Corporate Com
All businesses and organizations possess knowledge. Knowledge in the form of news, insights, opinions, trends, figures, facts about the business and its results, people, know-how. We help you find the relevant stories. We transform knowledge into frames and engaging content. We write and produce in genres and channels that fit the purpose.

Brand Platform
We shape Corporate Branding platforms that transcend mere identity. We don’t just define a company’s position; we breathe life into it. Imagine seamlessly integrated strategies and activities that pulsate with purpose. From mission statements that resonate to Brand Pyramids that unveil your essence, from compelling core narratives to taglines that echo in the minds of your audience – we create a brand universe that captivates. Plus, we orchestrate the activation.

PR
We give you sound communications advice. We see the ‘bigger picture’ – something that can be challenging when you’re in-house and ‘in the thick of it’ and we help you define your business offer, audience, objectives and strategy. Then we execute, i.e. manage your brand’s reputation through a mix of communications tools – e.g. articles and reviews, paid media (e.g. advertorials and sponsored articles) and speaker platforms, social media and other digital marketing services, like SEO, PPC, email marketing and so on.

Campaigns
At Schultz Jørgensen & K, we don’t just run campaigns; we engineer movements. Whether it’s information campaigns reshaping behaviors and lifestyles, branding endeavors that define organizations, attitude-shifting projects for political entities and NGOs, or recruitment masterstrokes attracting leaders and specialists – we’re the architects of change. Sure, we’re driven by data, but what truly propels our efforts is emotion and narrative. We understand that to foster real change, we need more than numbers; we need meaning. It’s about crafting compelling narratives that resonate on emotional frequencies. It’s about simplicity and impact. Because in the end, change isn’t just about information; it’s about touching hearts and minds.

Leadership Communication
In the realm of knowledge-intensive companies, Leadership Communication is the heartbeat of progress. It’s the art of weaving the company’s strategies, visions, and values into the fabric of leadership – an intricate dance of priorities, rhetoric, and behavior. True leadership communication goes beyond speeches and presentations. It’s about embodying the essence of the company in every decision, every word, and every action. It’s the ability to not only articulate the company’s strategies but also to execute them in tandem with the employees. Change isn’t just a concept; it’s a shared journey, and leadership communication is the compass guiding us toward our collective goals.

Sustainability Communication
In the landscape of sustainable development, mere promises won’t suffice. At Schultz Jørgensen & K, we understand that showcasing your dedication to sustainability isn’t just about words; it’s about tangible action. Honest communication isn’t just a reflection of your company’s ethos; it’s a testament to your genuine contribution to environmental and social causes. Sustainability communication, as we perceive it, is far more than a corporate obligation – it’s a strategic imperative. It’s a dynamic approach that resonates with stakeholders, be they conscious consumers looking up to you or institutional investors actively seeking sustainability champions. We craft narratives that go beyond the surface, weaving stories of genuine impact and progress, inspiring change in every word we communicate.

Core Narrative
A well-constructed and well-organized corporate narrative is a powerful thing. It explains what you do and why you matter. It can build market impact, build momentum and legitimacy – and create a more cohesive business. In short: Core narratives are a structured approach to organizing core beliefs, truths and facts about your organization.

How We Work:
We synthesize. First, we gather data and inspiration from all relevant fields. Then we focus strategies and communication. This approach is special in a society often characterized by tunnel vision, managerial silo thinking, political polarization, and social exclusion. Insted, we create coherence through extensive business understanding, insights from a think tank, experience from political life, the mediating strength of a media, and the creative energy of a cultural actor. Traditional silo thinking in the field of communication – with disciplines such as marketing, PR, content, branding, Public Affairs – make only little sense in modern companies and organizations. Therefore, we offer advice in three ways: How to listen – stakeholders, markets, trends. How to plan your effort – strategies, plans, coordination. How to communicate – messages, narratives, media.
